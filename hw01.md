## computer                       
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.

计算机是可以被指示执行的序列的装置算术或逻辑通过自动操作的计算机编程。现代计算机能够遵循通用的操作集，称为程序。这些程序使计算机能够执行极其广泛的任务。

## Alan Turing
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality (which was then considered a crime in the UK). 

阿兰·图灵西森 OBE FRS（/ TJ ʊər ɪ ŋ / 1912 6月23日- 7 1954年6月）是一名英国计算机科学家，数学家，逻辑学家，密码分析学家，哲学家，理论生物学家。图灵是在开发具有高度影响力理论计算机科学，提供的概念的形式化算法和计算与图灵机，其可以被认为是一个模型的通用计算机。图灵被广泛认为是理论计算机科学和人工智能之父。然而，他也是一个悲剧人物：一个英雄，由于他的同性恋在他的一生中从未在他的祖国完全被承认，这在英国是犯罪。

##  Moore’s law
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.In 1975,looking forward to the next decade,he revised the forecast to doubling every two years.The period is often quoted as 18 months because of a prediction by Intel executive David House (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster)

摩尔定律观察到密集集成电路中的晶体管数量大约每两年翻一番。这一观察结果以飞兆半导体和英特尔的联合创始人戈登·摩尔命名，其1965年的论文描述了每个集成电路的元件数量每年翻番，[2]并且预计这种增长率至少会持续到另一个十年。[3] 1975年，[4]期待下一个十年，[5]他将预测修改为每两年翻一番。[6] [7] [8]由于英特尔执行官大卫·豪斯（David House）的预测，该时期通常被引用为18个月（由更多晶体管和晶体管的效果组合更快）。
